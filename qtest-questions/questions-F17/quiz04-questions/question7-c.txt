The following method is supposed to take a number of students, a minimum length of a meeting, and a number of minutes available for student meetings, and return a message explaining the division of meeting time among students. Unfortunately it contains two mistakes. Identify the mistakes and fix them. Enough test cases to discover the mistakes are already written for you.
